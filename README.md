This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Install all Dependencies first :
1) Create a Folder (eg-innobytesFrontend) -> Install node (https://nodejs.org) -> npm is automatically installed with nodejs.
2) Create Next app using : ``` npx create-next-app@latest ```
3) Go to the directory where you created your next app, then delete all files and directories except .next and node-module directory.
4) Then download all codes from my repository then paste inside your nextapp directory.
now everything is set,

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
If you want to edit different sections of this website you can feel free to edit, just go to `app/` here you can find
all codes , so anything you want to edit you can edite from here.




## Additional Information
This Next.js application was developed despite being a beginner with Next.js. I encountered numerous challenges during development but addressed them one by one. The application is designed entirely using CSS instead of Bootstrap, as I am more proficient in CSS and find it offers greater flexibility for designing from scratch, resulting in a more user-friendly interface. Additionally, I implemented mobile-responsive features using CSS, although the optimization is tailored specifically for devices with a width of 350px.
